# Advanced DDoS Attack Simulation Script

This repository contains an **Advanced DDoS Attack Simulation Script** written in Python by **Adil Munawar**. The script demonstrates various methods to simulate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack for ethical purposes such as network stress testing and security research. **Important: This script is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script against any system is illegal.**

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Execution**: Leverages multi-threading to send packets rapidly and efficiently, simulating high-traffic conditions.
- **Protocol Selection (UDP/TCP)**: Choose between UDP or TCP protocols based on the target's service.
- **Target Validation**: Validates if the target IP is reachable before initiating the attack to avoid sending packets to an invalid target.
- **Rate Limiting**: Allows users to control how many packets are sent per second to avoid overwhelming the attacker's system.
- **Command-line Argument Parsing**: Easily input parameters such as IP, port, protocol, and rate through command-line arguments for seamless automation.
- **Logging and Progress**: Displays real-time status of the attack, including the number of packets sent, target IP, and port.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubHere/Advanced-DDos-Script.git
   cd Advanced-DDos-Script
   ```

2. Install required libraries (If any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ddos_attack.py [IP] [Port] --threads [Threads] --rate [Packets per second] --protocol [UDP/TCP]
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   python ddos_attack.py 192.168.0.1 80 --threads 4 --rate 100 --protocol UDP
   ```

4. Monitor the attack progress through the console output.

## Important Notes
- **Ethical Usage Only**: This tool should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of this script is illegal and could result in severe consequences.
- **Educational Purpose**: The script is designed to demonstrate network stress testing techniques and improve understanding of potential vulnerabilities in systems.
